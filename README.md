This web app was created for the IBM On Demand Community. The app was developed using Bluemix
to run on a node.js server. It also makes use of a Cloudant database and the Watson Language
Translator. It was created in support of the Toy Box Club Activity Kit whose goal is to develop
critical thinking skills through video game design. For information, visit:
